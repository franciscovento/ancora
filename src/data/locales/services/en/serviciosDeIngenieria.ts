            Considering the results of the analysis conducted, an action plan is established. This improvement plan aims to help the client achieve optimal risk levels by establishing best practices and standardising operations.
            <b>ANCORA</b> offers a scheme of recommendations focused on different execution periods:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-anc-text text-sm list-disc ml-5">
            <li>TYPE A: less than 45 days.</li>
            <li>TYPE B: between 46 and 90 days.</li>
            <li>TYPE C: between 91 and 180 days.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All action plans are implemented as different execution stages are overcome, as the ultimate goal is to achieve low levels of exposure as long as they are associated with protecting the assets and interests of our client.

          <b>ANCORA</b> provides its rating methodology, which has been endorsed by several insurers in Latin America. With the incorporated rating methodology, ANCORA compares risks of similar industries, comparing their levels of protection and exposure. This allows policyholders to be categorised through better standards.
          <br /> <br />
          This method consists of a quantitative measurement segmented into 10 major categories consisting of 60 variables, providing an underwriter with better tools to make decisions when taking on risk or establishing conditions in their estimate proposals.
