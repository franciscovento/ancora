      <p>
        Errors and Omissions Insurance, also known as Professional Liability insurance, is a policy that protects companies and their employees, regardless of their position or hierarchy within the organization, in the event of a third party alleging suffering a financial loss as a result of negligence, error, or omission purportedly committed by the insured company’s employee.
      <br /><br />
        It is designed to allow professionals to carry out their work with a certain peace of mind, providing protection for their assets against third-party claims for errors or omissions. 
      <br />
      <br />
        Various professions can be specifically insured, each with unique terms and conditions, including:
      <br />
      <br />
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 text-anc-text">
    <li>Financial Institutions</li>
    <li>Doctors, Dentists, and Nurses (Medical Malpractice)</li>

    <li>Technology Companies</li>
    <li>Insurance and Reinsurance Agents</li>
    <li>Law Firms</li>
    <li>Accounting/Tax Firms</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p class="pb-6">
    However, any professional service can be insured, and we can offer coverage for it. Whether a company offers its professional services to various clients and wants to protect its assets in case it needs to respond to an error or omission, or if it is a company seeking protection against any damage caused by a supplier’s error or omission, we can provide ad hoc insurance policies covering either a single project or every project and service offered throughout the policy’s period of validity.
