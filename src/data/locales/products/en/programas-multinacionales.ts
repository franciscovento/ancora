    All companies that, due to expansion or operational strategy, need to expand their operations to more than one country, must structure their risks according to local regulations and standards, making the integration and management of these risks more complex.
    <br /><br />
    Assets and operations abroad are often subject to local requirements, both legal and commercial, which in turn need to be aligned with the policies and decisions of their parent company, often resulting in a complex portfolio of products for the company.
    <br /><br />
    At <strong>ANCORA</strong>, we specialize in managing Multinational Programmes, which are directly handled by our international programme department. Through this department, we centralize legal and commercial requirements, ensuring the proper risk management and insurance of our clients’ assets.
